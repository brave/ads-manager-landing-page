        <strong>We have been thrilled about the results that we’ve seen from our Brave Ads campaigns</strong> in recent
        months. The push notifications and sponsored images complement each other really well—sponsored images allow us
        to reach people worldwide who otherwise might not have found out about our brand, and push notifications give
        them that extra nudge to convert. The sponsored images were originally meant to be an awareness play, but we are
        now seeing conversions from the sponsored images alone and couldn't be more excited. As an added bonus, people
        are posting about the sponsored images on Twitter and Reddit which further demonstrates the success of this
        campaign.

        <h1>BlockFi's Challenge</h1>
        <p>
          BlockFi, a crypto-financial services company, set out to reach high net-worth investors with an appetite for
          digital assets in a digital advertising ecosystem. With increased regulations, BlockFi often found that
          traditional advertising channels such as Facebook were unpredictable. Some of their ads would be approved, and
          some would be rejected in an inconsistent manner. Banner ads on crypto ad networks and industry news sources
          were costly. Performance fell short of BlockFi’s customer acquisition goals, and at times, the authenticity of
          quality traffic was questioned. In addition, the thousands of investors that BlockFi serves today prefer
          anonymity, privacy and are well equipped with VPNs and privacy tools such as Brave. For this reason, BlockFi
          realized they needed an "unblockable" media program that could break through the clutter and reach an
          incremental audience that is nearly impossible to reach programmatically.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h1>Solution</h1>
        <p>BlockFi chose Brave User Ads: Push Notifications combined with Sponsored Images as their preferred
          advertising solution. Brave's trust-based approach to advertising was key in reaching BlockFi’s users. Within
          the first few days, BlockFi had lead conversions simply because of Brave’s strategic ad matching technology
          and because of the opt-in nature of the ad. BlockFi immediately realized that their customer acquisition cost
          was 50-75% lower with Brave than with Google, and that the users acquired via Brave Ads were much more engaged
          with BlockFi’s product. BlockFi’s Sponsored Image—a stunning billboard-like ad format—captured the
          attention of millions of Brave users, some of whom mentioned the memorable creative on Twitter and Reddit and
          further amplified BlockFi’s brand awareness and product offerings.

        <p><strong>Brave has proven to be one of the most effective channels</strong> in driving new customers to
          BlockFi. The opt-in experience creates deeper engagement that consistently results in a 3x higher CTR than any
          of our other paid media spend. The Brave Ads team has been helpful since day one, providing best practices and
          helping us scale with the audience as the platform matures. Everything from the order form to campaign
          optimization, it has been a professional experience and we continue to see value month over month.
