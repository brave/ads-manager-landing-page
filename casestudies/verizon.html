        <h1>Verizon's Challenge</h1>
        <p>
          In an effort to support small businesses nationwide during the COVID-19 pandemic, Verizon - the world’s
          leading providers of technology, communications, information and entertainment products and services -
          partnered with prominent entertainment celebrities such as Dave Mathews and Usher to launch the Verizon
          PayItForward LIVE campaign, which consisted of weekly livestream events to drive awareness for viewers to
          support local businesses in their communities.
        </p>
        <p>To deliver the greatest impact, Verizon aimed to extend the PayItForward LIVE campaign to connect with new
          audiences through platform channels where the PayItForward LIVE message was most likely to resonate and invoke
          engagement. ‘Paying it forward’ is already well established in the Brave ethos, as the integrated Rewards
          features provides the ability for users to directly support the growing network of +800K Brave Creators. Based
          on user research, Brave’s almost 20M monthly active users are not exposed to programmatic ads on the web, and
          avoid social media platforms like Facebook and Snapchat, with 6 in 10 users claiming to install ad blockers if
          they aren’t browsing on Brave. By extending the PayItForward LIVE campaign to Brave, Verizon could reach an
          entirely new audience and maximize their campaign success.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h1>Solution</h1>
        <p>The Brave and Verizon PayItForward LIVE advertising campaign implemented a multifaceted strategy. The
          <strong>Brave Ads: Push Notifications</strong> + <strong>Sponsored Images</strong> were used in conjunction
          with <strong>Social Drivers</strong>. The social driver was a way for users to share their tune-in intent on
          Twitter to create widespread campaign awareness. This strategy resulted in 23.8M Brave Ad views, a blended CTR
          of 8%, and 1,100 tweets. The strategy focused on executing a mix of ad units and placements, programmed on a
          weekly schedule to drive program awareness, generate tune-in demand for live events, and invoke social
          awareness and participation from Brave users on Twitter.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to the Brave Ads, Brave generated additional excitement and buzz for the Verizon PayItForward LIVE
          campaign through the BAT Community. PayItForward LIVE was featured in a homepage tile placement for 175K
          monthly visitors to view, and helped rally additional ground-level support and participation.

        <p><strong>As we thought about how to integrate an emerging tech solution</strong> that could expand the
          campaign to reach new audiences, <strong>Brave seemed like a perfect fit.</strong> Due to the organic audience
          of daily active users who use Brave, an idea of building an already large audience through Sponsored Images in
          combination with Brave’s ability to communicate to the right users in non-traditional ad units appealed to
          Verizon’s core objective. The exposure using Brave's highly engaged community of users and their teams ability
          to execute with speed were paramount to the success of these efforts.
