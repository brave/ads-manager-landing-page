      <h2>Culprit's Challenge</h2>
      <p>
        Culprit was not satisfied with Facebook advertisements. They were competing for the same audience as every other
        underwear company, and regardless of how creative they were with their content, and how great their product was,
        inferior products could simply outspend on advertising dollars and get the sale.
      </p>
      <p>Facebook’s pay to play felt
        like a chain of diminishing returns. They wanted to reach an audience that was wider than their base and their
        goal was to rapidly increase their sales.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h2>Solution</h2>
      <p>Culprit chose Brave User Ads because of its unique approach to advertising. Culprit rapidly saw that
        privacy-respecting ads, that allowed customers to opt-in to view them, created a much more receptive audience
        and dramatically increased their sales by 500% in just two weeks.
      </p>
      <p>
        With Brave’s ad platform, Culprit was able to
        tap into a previously unreachable audience and drive traffic to Culprit’s landing page that included a promo
        video and a discount code for Brave users. The high quality site traffic allowed for deeper engagement and
        immediately increased profits.

    <h1>Who is Culprit</h1>
    <p>After being named Forbes 30 under 30 in Marketing & Advertising, Co-Founders David Dinetz & Dylan Trussell
      decided to market products they designed themselves. Underwear was unanimously favored as the most fun canvas for
      their wild cinematic aesthetic and Culprit Underwear was born. With a robust marketing team already in place, this
      self financed company set out to make the world’s highest quality underwear supported by equally high-end content.
